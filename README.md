# CPU Test Engineer| COMP-699-F.SP25

This repository contains my work for the Professional Seminar course (COMP-699-F.SP25).

As a **CPU Test Engineer**, I developed, optimized, and ran Chisel-based test scenarios to validate the CPUâ€™s execution units to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability.

## Project Focus
- Built modular Chisel testbenches for:
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  - Load Unit
  - Store Unit
  - Branch Unit
- Developed directed and random tests to verify unit functionality.
- Integrated tests into the simulation environment with coverage collection.
- Debugged failures and collaborated with design teams for improvements.
- Ensured tests were compatible with continuous integration (CI/CD) systems.
- Documented verification strategies and results.

## Tasks Completed
- **Sprint 1**: ALU Verification
- **Sprint 2**: Load Unit Verification
- **Sprint 3**: Store Unit Verification
- **Sprint 4**: Branch Unit Verification and System-Level Random Testing

Each sprint involved:
- Creating unit-level and integration-level tests.
- Debugging issues and regression failures.
- Analyzing simulation waveforms and coverage metrics.
- Continuously improving the testbench and methodologies.
